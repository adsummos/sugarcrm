REST Bindings for SugarCRM!  

== SUMMARY: 

RubyGem for interacting with SugarCRM via REST.  

== Description:

I've implemented all of the basic API calls that SugarCRM supports, and am actively building an abstraction layer
on top of the basic API methods.  The end result will be ActiveRecord style finders and first class objects.  Some 
of this functionality is included today. 

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Auto-generation of Module specific objects.  When a connection is established, get_available_modules is called and the resultant modules are turned into SugarCRM::Module classes.  
* If you just want to use the vanilla API, you can access the methods directly on the connection object.

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'sugarcrm'
  # Establish a connection
  SugarCRM::Base.establish_connection("http://localhost/sugarcrm", 'user', 'password', {:debug => false})

  # Retrieve a user by ID, using the SugarCRM::User Proxy object
  SugarCRM::User.find(id)
  
  # Show a list of available modules
  SugarCRM.modules
  
  # Use the HTTP for direct API calls
  SugarCRM.connection.get_entry(1)

  # Lookup a user by name.  Find any associated accounts
  SugarCRM::User.find_by_username('sarah').accounts
  
  # Same operation, but using the direct API calls
  SugarCRM.connection.get_entry_list(
    "Users",
    "users.user_name = \'sarah\'",
    {
      :link_fields => [
        {
          "name"  => "accounts",
          "value" => ["id", "name"]
        }
      ]          
    } 
  )

== REQUIREMENTS:

* >= activesupport 3.0.0 gem
* json gem

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install sugarcrm

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
